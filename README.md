# Code2Hundred
2nd sem CSE project
Both GUI.java and the jar file need the images in same directory/folder to run properly.
the jar file needs java runtime version of 15, if JNI error appears you need to update it (openjdk 15)
in GUI.java run the main method of the GUI class
If opening GUI.java in an IDE you need the JSON and JSOUP jar files to build path / add them as dependencies.
